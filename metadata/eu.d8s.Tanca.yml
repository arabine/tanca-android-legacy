Summary: Pétanque contest manager (tournaments)
Description: |-
    Tanca is a simple application that can help you organize a Pétanque 
    contest.
    
    Add players and create teams, the app will generate the game rounds 
    for you and see the final ranking.

    The first round is generated using a random algorithm and the next 
    rounds use the Blossom algorithm to perfectly pair teams 
    (best teams play with best other ones).
